# Best Practices

## Keep the UI calm

- Avoid strong changes in colors, big jumps in layouts, or popping elements on simple interactions.

- Avoid strong accent colors for no reason. Using accent colors when you aren't trying to get the user's attention only creates visual noise and clutter that harms the user experience. The UI should be calm with slight contrasts unless there's good reason to do so. Getting this right early on will do good for long term editor-user communication.

- If the design breaks away from Bevy Editor's design practices, the reasoning should be well thought-out and documented. Inconsistency should be reserved for drawing attention to elements that work in unique or surprising ways.

## Workflow Oriented

When addressing things in the Ui, focus on actions not things. Prefer verbs over nouns.

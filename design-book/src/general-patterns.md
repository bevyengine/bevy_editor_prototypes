# General Patterns

- Try to ensure that the reading direction of information: data, is carried in the same direction as the user's language.
- Until localization is available only consider Left-to-Right, Top-to_bottom reading directions.

## Editors

- Editor views such as 3D scene/2D scene, where exact coordinates matter, should have a grid background (In a 3d context this means the "ground" plane.)

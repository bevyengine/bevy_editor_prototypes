# Pane Layout

## Order of Importance

- More important fields and tools should be given more visual prominence. This can be achieved with positioning, size, contrast or folding elements.
- If every setting in a sub-panel is predicated on something being enabled, the toggle should be in the header.

## Enums

- If a enum is more than 3 items, it should be a drop down.

## Sub-Panels

- When you have closely related options you should group them into a sub-panel.
- This allows for collapsing enabling a user to minimize noise from things they aren't using.

## THIS SHOULD BE IMPROVED OVER TIME

- These layout rules are not set in stone.
- If you have an idea for improvement, make a PR so it can be discussed.

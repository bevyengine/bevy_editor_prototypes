# Themes and Styles

The editor uses a number of style rules for best-practice accessibility and clarity.

## Icons

We're temporarily using [the Lucide icon set](https://lucide.dev/) for icons in the editor.[^lucide_pr] It's a helpful placeholder, as it includes a great deal of icons helpful for denoting game development operations. Lucide is also a font, making it easier to include in modern versions of Bevy.

[^lucide_pr]:
    Contributors introduced it [in PR #213](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy_editor_prototypes/pull/213) for some helpful placeholders. Since its a font, Bevy doesn't need SVG support to include it!

    Additional or different icons will be designed/chosen in the future.

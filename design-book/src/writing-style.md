# Writing Style

## Common Rules

- Bevy uses American English.
- Text should be clear and to the point.
- Language should be targeted at the lowest level of technical expertise needed to clearly understand an explanation.
- Entity, component, resource, system, event and asset are the critical technical vocabulary for all Bevy users to learn, no matter what their role is.
- Do not use English contractions like aren’t, can’t, etc.
- Single character identifiers, like X/Y/Z etc. are always capitalized.

## UI

- Use MLA Title case for UI labels. (See this [overview](https://titlecaseconverter.com/rules/#MLA))
- Avoid redundancy. For example do not use Enable, Activate, Is, Use, or similar words for boolean properties, just a checkbox.

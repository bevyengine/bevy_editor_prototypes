# Writing Style

## Common Rules

- Bevy uses American English.
- Text should be clear and to the point.
- Language should be targeted at the lowest level of technical expertise needed to clearly understand an explanation.
- Entity, component, resource, system, event and asset are the critical technical vocabulary for all Bevy users to learn, no matter what their role is.
- Avoid contractions, abbreviations and acronyms where possible.
- Single character identifiers, like X/Y/Z etc. are always capitalized.

## UI

- Use [MLA title case](https://titlecaseconverter.com/rules/#MLA) for UI labels.
- Avoid redundancy. For example do not use Enable, Activate, Is, Use, or similar words for boolean properties, just a checkbox.
